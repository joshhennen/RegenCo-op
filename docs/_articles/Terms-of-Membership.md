REGENCO-OP uses GitHub to manage its Members. You do not need to be a Member to look at our GitHub but if you wish to post articles on the website or be able to influence the direction of the REGENCO-OP you must be a Member.

By joining the REGENCO-OP GitHub you do not become a Full Member.  By joining the GitHub you are a Contributing Member. To become a Full Member is simply that you must be willing to interact on a much more personal basis. We have compiled these points that are important for that relationship: 

*You must agree with the following mission statement:
	
    To bring people together to find and implement solutions to allow a sustainable future for all people and all life.

*Be willing to help in any way you can. We neither need or want any money at this time though it will be necessary to discuss money sooner or later. What we need right now are people interested in the problem and interested in working together to find a solution. 

*The following forms of discrimination will be discussed in a way that allows for an understanding of why they exist and if they are well reasoned or not:
	
    Age, within reason: right now 13 is the youngest a Full Member may be. This is of course an arbitrary number and really it comes down to a certain level of understanding and responsibility. If someone younger than 13 demonstrates their understanding and responsibleness they can become a Full Member. If anyone of any age shows a lack of understanding or irresponsibility that member may be asked to renounce their Membership. Besides it's our children's future so why shouldn’t even the youngest have a say in how it happens? 

    NOTE: Children can not be forced to become members by their parents. ALL MEMBERSHIP IS VOLUNTARY.	

    NOTE: If a parent does not want their child to be a member we will remove them and all correspondence from the website ONLY IF THE CHILD AGREES WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT IF THEY DO NOT. Request must be made by notarized postmarked mail.

    Gender: You don’t choose what gender you are born. We want to bring balance and harmony between all life and the division of genders is one of the deepest rooted there is.  
    
	Race: You don’t choose what ethnicity you are born. This is the second deepest division that exists. 

	National Origin: You don’t choose where you were born. This is one of the most absurd divisions that exists. Invented very recently by forces bent on using the tactic of divide and conquer in as many ways as possible. 
	
	Sexual orientation: Intimacy in love should not be restricted, you can love and be intimate with who ever you want.

	Socioeconomic Status: We may be born into wealth or born into poverty. Some people make what turns out to be a good decision, work hard or get lucky to acquire wealth and some make some bad decision, have a mental illness or physical disability or have some bad luck and find themselves in poverty.

	Personal Habits: There is a lot of disagreement on what people should 	or should not do. All we can do is study people's habits and gather data on those habits and then educate those with the habit so they can make an informed decision. All of us do things that may be contrary to our best interest so it is hypocritical to discriminate against others with “bad habits”
	
	Religion: You can believe what you want but you should try not push your religion onto others and you must not use it as the only basis for making decisions or arguing your case. 

*When contributing to the REGENCO-OP proper etiquette is required. Use your best judgment. The REGENCO-OP will not be policed by the administrators. If a complaint is made to the administrators  it will be reviewed and dealt with on a case by case basis. This will most likely consist of moderating a discussion between the disagreeing parties.

*You must use your real first and last name, no aliases. This is required to assure the authenticity of the member and prevent one person from creating multiple memberships. REGENCO-OP abhors secrecy because you always have to ask what are they hiding, what are they AFRAID OF? This is what corporations and governments do and we want no part of it. 

*You must not be an agent of a company or government or a private individual with the intent of causing any harm to REGENCO-OP.
